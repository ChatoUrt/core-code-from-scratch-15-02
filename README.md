## ---Client-Server Model---

Q/A:

1. What is a Server?

//A set of computers which recieve client's request and return a concordance

2. What is a Client?

// It's the way to call the user using a device trying to acces to any web service.

3. Is a server just another physical computer?

// Yes and no. A server can works in any computer but the server exist in thw web as a software

    3.1. Why do we refer to a certain class of applications as Servers?

	// Because those class of application use to store information as databases

    3.2. What is the difference?

	// The difference about server in apps and servers online is that one store the 
	   infomation locally, in the app in this case, and in the web, it's stored online.

4. Is there any similarity between human communication and the client-server model?

// Yes there are. The similarity are that the way how we communicate with people, talking
by letters or any other type of tool is the same as the client ask and receive information and
data from the server. It's complex than that but works in the same way, basically

    4.1. List some examples

	// Transmitter and receiver
	   Channel
	   The language

5. Is the client-server model applicable only to the Web?

// No. There are already new private platformns, application and also some companies have
their own servers on site which work just for stuff

    5.1. Do desktop applications use the client-server model?

	// Yeah they do. Ussually only the user can access to those application

    5.2. Can you mention any other example of this model outside the Web?

	// For example in videogames consoles. They allow you play online paying the
	   subscription by account. It's a client-server model that go to servers of the 
	   console's companies but internal it works or not depending of the account
	   because games are available for all games, but just work connected to the web
	   and being the user who's paid the subscription.

## ---HTTP---

Q/A:

1. What is HTTP?

// Basically it's the "language" of the web to access to the correct web address

2. What is a Communication Protocol?

// It's a system of rules that allow the communication between 2 or more entitites to transfer
any type of information requested

    2.1. Do humans use communication protocols?

	//We used them, not only in technology. We do it in any process, paperwork, or any 
	  common interaction.

3. What is a Request in HTTP?

// It's a message has sent by the client to the web server requesting an action

4. What is a Response in HTTP?

//Opposite to Request, response it's what the client gets by the server, being the result
needed or denying an access.

5. What is an HTTP method?

// It's the available resource that the client has to manage in a better way the information
client request or response with 

6. What are HTTP request headers?

It's a request which contains more context about the typeof request, the additional information
is being asked by the client. It can contain specified content about what's being asked.

## ---APIs---

Q/A:

1. What is an API?

// It's the bridge between products and services get contact automatically

2. What is a Protocol?

//It's group of rules that rule the instructions to work properly

3. Is the term API only applicable to the communication of programs over the Internet?

//Yes. The name describes the funtion of what APIs do. There similarities with real life cases
but it's just applicable to programs and application work connecting to internet.

4. Why is structured communication between two programs important?

//Because this provides a better way to manage and check the information we are receiving and
sending.

    4.1. Do we humans use APIs when communicating without technology?

	// Not exactly an API, but we have example can be comparable with how API works 

5. Is an API just another program or a standard?

//Api it's another type of program, but as a software.

6. Do you know any API? Can you list at least 5 examples of APIs?

// TokApi
   Google search
   Deezer
   Imgur
   Instagram

## ---From JSON to REST---

Q/A:

1. What is JSON?

// It's a new formart to make it easier to understand between human and machine.

    1.1. Is JSON the same as a plain Javascript object?

	 //No, it's not the same becausoe of the syntaxis. JSON cannot contain functions.

2. What is REST?

	// It's an interface that connects many systems based on HTTP protocol

    2.1. Is REST a programming language, framework, technology, or architecture pattern?

	// It's an architecture pattern that connect a computer with oters to access to the th info

3. What is a Resource in REST?

// They are the basic component in the RESTful service. Resources are addressable by URLs and
    HTTP methods can perform operations on resources.

    3.1. What is a resource identifier?

	//The Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) it's in charge of access to any resource of API REST
	   

4. How are HTTP and REST related?

// They are related because of the type of methods and protocols both use HTTP working with
RESTful and REST working with the bases of HTTP methods 

    4.1. What HTTP methods does REST use within its architecture rules?

	// The HTTP methods of the REST API provide the operations available on Rule Execution 
	   Server artifacts, such as create, read, update, and delete.

    4.2. Why do we use HTTP methods in REST and how do they relate to resources?

	// We use them for the correct web architecture becuase are related with the basic 
	   resources employed in our websites

5. Is REST the same as HTTP? 

// No, because REST it's a set of attributes of a particular architectural style, and HTTP it's a
   protocol that happens to exhibit many features of a RESTful system.
